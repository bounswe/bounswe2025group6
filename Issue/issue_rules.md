# 📝 Issue Reporting Rules  

## 📌 General Guidelines  
- Each issue should be **clear, detailed, and structured**.  
- The title format should be: **"Verb + Noun"** (e.g., *Fix login bug*, *Add dark mode*). The title belongs in the "Add a title" section, not in the description. 
- Title should be **concise enough** that we can understand the issue at a glance.
- The description must be **detailed enough** that someone with no prior knowledge can understand it deeply.  
- Each issue should use **proper labels** (type, priority, workload) for easier tracking.  
- Each issue **MUST** satisfy the [Must Have Structure](#must-have-structure).  
- Try to avoid assigning an issue to more than **two assignees**.
- Try to avoid assigning an issue to more than **three reviewers**.
