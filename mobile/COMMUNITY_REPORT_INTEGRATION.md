# Community Posts Report Integration

## Overview

The report service has been successfully integrated into the community posts screens. Users can now report inappropriate posts with a simple tap.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Post Detail Screen (`lib/screens/community/post_detail_screen.dart`)

#### Added Imports:
```dart
import '../../models/report.dart';
import '../../widgets/report_button.dart';
```

#### Added Report Button to AppBar:
- **For Own Posts**: Users see Edit and Delete buttons (existing functionality)
- **For Other Users' Posts**: Users see a Report button (üö© flag icon)

**Implementation:**
```dart
actions: [
  // Show edit/delete for own posts
  if (post != null && _currentUserId != null && post!['author_id'] == _currentUserId) ...[
    IconButton(icon: const Icon(Icons.edit), onPressed: _navigateToEditScreen),
    IconButton(icon: const Icon(Icons.delete), onPressed: _showDeleteConfirmation),
  ],
  // Show report button for other users' posts
  if (post != null && _currentUserId != null && post!['author_id'] != _currentUserId)
    ReportButton(
      contentType: ReportContentType.post,
      objectId: post!['id'],
      contentPreview: post!['title'] ?? 'Post',
      onReportSubmitted: () {
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          const SnackBar(
            content: Text('Thank you for reporting. We will review this post.'),
            duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
          ),
        );
      },
    ),
],
```

### 2. Community Screen (`lib/screens/community/community_screen.dart`)

#### Added Imports:
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import '../../models/report.dart';
import '../../services/storage_service.dart';
import '../../widgets/report_dialog.dart';
```

#### Enhanced PostCard Widget:

**Added User ID Detection:**
```dart
int? _currentUserId;

Future<void> _loadCurrentUserId() async {
  final token = await StorageService.getJwtAccessToken();
  if (token != null) {
    try {
      final parts = token.split('.');
      if (parts.length != 3) return;
      final payload = jsonDecode(
        utf8.decode(base64Url.decode(base64Url.normalize(parts[1]))),
      );
      if (mounted) {
        setState(() {
          _currentUserId = payload['user_id'] as int?;
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error silently
    }
  }
}
```

**Added Menu Button with Report Option:**
```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
  children: [
    Expanded(child: Text(widget.post['title'] ?? '')),
    // Show report icon for other users' posts
    if (!isOwnPost && _currentUserId != null)
      PopupMenuButton<String>(
        icon: const Icon(Icons.more_vert),
        itemBuilder: (context) => [
          PopupMenuItem<String>(
            value: 'report',
            child: const Row(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.flag_outlined, color: Colors.red),
                SizedBox(width: 8),
                Text('Report Post'),
              ],
            ),
            onTap: () async {
              await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100));
              if (!context.mounted) return;
              
              await ReportDialog.show(
                context: context,
                contentType: ReportContentType.post,
                objectId: widget.post['id'],
                contentPreview: widget.post['title'] ?? 'Post',
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
  ],
)
```

## User Experience

### Post Detail Screen
1. User opens a post they didn't create
2. They see a flag icon (üö©) in the AppBar
3. Clicking it opens the report dialog
4. User selects report type (Spam, Inappropriate, Harassment, Other)
5. User optionally adds description
6. User submits report
7. Confirmation message shown

### Community Screen (Post List)
1. User sees posts in the community feed
2. For posts they didn't create, a menu icon (‚ãÆ) appears
3. Clicking the menu shows "Report Post" option
4. Selecting it opens the report dialog
5. Same flow as above

## Smart Features

‚úÖ **User Detection**: Automatically determines if post belongs to current user  
‚úÖ **Conditional Display**: Report option only shown for other users' posts  
‚úÖ **Token Parsing**: Extracts user ID from JWT token without extra API calls  
‚úÖ **Graceful Handling**: Silently handles token parsing errors  
‚úÖ **Context Safety**: Always checks `context.mounted` before showing dialogs  
‚úÖ **User Feedback**: Shows confirmation after successful report  

## Security & Privacy

- Users **cannot** report their own posts
- User ID extracted from authenticated JWT token
- All report API calls require authentication
- Reports are sent to backend for moderation review

## Report Types Available

When reporting a post, users can select from:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| üö´ **Spam** | Unsolicited or repetitive content |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inappropriate** | Offensive or inappropriate material |
| üò† **Harassment** | Bullying or harassment |
| üìù **Other** | Other issues |

## Testing the Integration

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Login as User A**
2. **Create a post** (using the + button)
3. **Logout and login as User B**
4. **Navigate to Community screen**
5. **Find User A's post**
6. **Click the menu icon (‚ãÆ)** on the post card
7. **Select "Report Post"**
8. **Fill out the report dialog**
9. **Submit the report**
10. **Verify success message appears**

### Also Test:

**Post Detail Screen:**

2. Verify flag icon appears in AppBar
3. Click flag icon
4. Complete report flow

**Own Posts:**
1. View your own post in the list
2. Verify **no menu icon** appears

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Report button doesn't appear"  
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in and viewing someone else's post

**Issue**: "Authentication error when reporting"  
**Solution**: Token might be expired. Try logging out and back in

**Issue**: "Can't see menu icon on post cards"  
**Solution**: User ID might not be loaded yet. Ensure token is valid

**Issue**: "Report submitted but no confirmation"  
**Solution**: Check backend is running and accessible at `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
