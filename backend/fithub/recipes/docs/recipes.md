### ‚úÖ Serializer Tips
Use NestedSerializers for RecipeIngredient to return ingredient + quantity/unit

Use SlugRelatedField or custom serializers for creator, media_files, etc.

### ‚úÖ Advanced Suggestions
Filtering & Search
Use django-filter + DRF's SearchFilter for filtering & searching recipes by ingredients, meal type, rating, etc.

Permissions
Ensure only creators or admins can edit/delete recipes. Use IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly + custom permissions.

Ratings Aggregation
Use fields like total_ratings, rating_count to compute average on update, or compute dynamically with @property.

Validation
Enforce validation rules like required fields, minimum ratings (0-5), acceptable units, etc. via serializer validation methods.

### ‚úÖ Optional Add-ons
Allergy Alerts: add a method on Recipe to scan all ingredients‚Äô allergens field and return potential risks.

Favorites: allow users to favorite recipes via ManyToMany.

Pagination: for recipe list responses.

Moderation: is_approved field for admin control.

Feature recipes: is_featured for home page curation.

#### Notes:
- Keep ratings tied to users so only one rating per user per recipe exists.
- Only the creator can delete their comment.
- Return flags like has_liked, user_rating, can_edit in recipe detail responses for the frontend to adjust UI.
