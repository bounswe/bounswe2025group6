# **User and Dietitian Registration & Email Verification**

## Overview

This update to the registration system introduces support for **regular users** and **dietitians**. Dietitians are required to provide a certification URL to prove their education. In addition, a process for **email verification** has been implemented, ensuring that users can only log in after verifying their email addresses.

### Key Updates:

1.  **User Registration**: Regular users can now register through the same endpoint.
    
2.  **Dietitian Registration**: Dietitians now have a registration process that includes providing a certification URL to verify their credentials.
    
3.  **Email Notifications**: A Gmail account has been set up to send email notifications for account verification.
    
4.  **Email Verification**: A new endpoint allows users to verify their email addresses before they can log in.

## Testing the Endpoints using Swagger

To test the **User Registration** and **Dietitian Registration** functionality, you can use **Swagger UI** through the frontend interface.

### How to Test:

1.  **Register a User**:
    
    -   Open Swagger and go to the `POST /api/register/` endpoint.
        
    -   In the request body, provide the necessary details for either a regular user or a dietitian.
        
    
    Example Request Body for Regular User:
    {
      "username": "regularjohn",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "secureUserPassword123",
      "usertype": "user"
    }

Example Request Body for Dietitian:

    {
      "username": "dietitianjohn",
      "email": "dietitian.john@example.com",
      "password": "secureDietitianPassword123",
      "usertype": "dietitian",
      "dietitian": {
        "certification_url": "https://example.com/certifications/john_certification"
      }
    }

1.  -   lick **Execute** to send the request.
        
    -   If successful, a confirmation message will appear indicating that the user has been registered and the email verification process has been triggered.
        
2.  **Verify Email**:
    
    -   After registration, the user will receive an email with a verification token.
        
    -   Open the `GET /api/verify-email/{verification_token}/` endpoint in Swagger.
        
    -   Replace `{verification_token}` with the actual token received in the email.
        
    -   Click **Execute** to verify the email.
        
    -   You should receive a success message confirming the email was verified.
        

----------

## Conclusion

With these updates, both **regular users** and **dietitians** can register on the platform, and email verification is required for all users before they can log in. These endpoints have been tested and are working as expected.

This documentation is intended to help frontend developers test the functionality via Swagger and understand the structure of requests and responses.
