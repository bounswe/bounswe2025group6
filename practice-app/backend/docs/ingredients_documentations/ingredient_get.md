### Quick Reminder:
- It's almost certain that I've made some mistakes or inconsistencies in the above documentation. Please review our swagger documentation and the code itself to ensure everything is accurate and up-to-date. If you find any discrepancies, please correct the documentation accordingly. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
- You can easily find the working endpoints and their request/response formats in the swagger documentation. Just run backend locally and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/` to access the swagger UI. You can also use the Postman collection provided in the repository for testing the endpoints but I strongly suggest using the swagger UI for better understanding and testing.
